We now have two versions of Pure. Pure version 1 came out in 2023 and is phasing out since 2024 - it's now in maintenance-only and won't receive upgrades in the future except bug fixes:
* The original [Pure (Version 1)](https://github.com/Pure-the-Language/Pure)
* The new [Pure 2](https://github.com/Pure-the-Language/Pure2) is part of the Parcel NExT platform, a POS-compliant C# interpreter (.Net 8) based on Roslyn. You should access this version from [Parcel NExT](https://github.com/Charles-Zhang-Parcel).
